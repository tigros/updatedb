Utility program to update a single folder or drive in a mysys database. Saves time if your system has millions of files.
On a newly created database, it will create 2 extra indexes which may take some time, but once they're created the next run(s) will be much faster.
This is for more advanced users with at least 5 million files, otherwise might as well just create a new database since it doesn't take very long.

The usage is simple: updatedb "X:\folder name"
You can also use a dot to specify current folder, or a folder name relative to it.
Use quotes if the path contains spaces.

Might be a good idea to use an elevated cmd prompt to include restricted files, if any.
Now in mysys, if you have tabs opened, click Search to refresh. If a drive was added or deleted, however, you'd need to open a new tab for it to be reflected in the Drives drop down list.

If you don't have mysys, give it a try. You can read more about it and download from https://integritech.ca, it is free to try for a full year! Full featured! Not even a nag nor ads.

For convenience, I've also included signed copies of MysysSetup.zip and FoxitReader10.1.0.37527_Setup.zip right here in the Releases section.

Never have trouble finding (or playing, or viewing) your files again, system wide!

Be assured there is no communication done by mysys to any servers whatsoever, well apart from the built-in web browser which can, but it was more intended for viewing local files.

Kindly star the repo if you find the software useful, thanks a bunch!
